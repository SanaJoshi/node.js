Create a terminal node app to-do list to help you with your day to day life.

- Browse the node api documentation?
- How can I read the keyboard? (hint: readline)
- What class structure/modules will I design?
- How would I write my to-do list to disk (hint: fs)

var multiply = function(num) {
  return num * 5;
}

rl.question('Whats a number? ', (answer) => {
  // TODO: Log the answer in a database
  // console.log(`Thank you for your valuable feedback: ${answer}`);
  console.log(`five times that amount is: ${multiply(answer)}`);

  rl.close();
});
